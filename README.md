# Rail Madad Complaint Management System

## Project Overview
The Rail Madad Complaint Management System is designed to enhance the process of reporting and resolving passenger grievances during train journeys. By leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI), this project automates the categorization and prioritization of complaints, making the entire complaint resolution process more efficient and responsive. The system allows passengers to submit complaints through various media, including images, videos, and text, which are then intelligently analyzed to ensure quick and accurate handling.

## Features
- **Automated Categorization and Prioritization**: Integrates AI to streamline the complaint management process by automatically classifying complaints based on visual content.
- **Image and Video Analysis**: Utilizes AI-powered recognition to identify issues such as cleanliness, damage, or staff behavior from submitted multimedia files.
- **Urgency Detection**: Implements AI to assess the severity of issues and prioritize complaints that require immediate attention.
- **Enhanced Data Extraction**:
  - **Text Recognition (OCR)**: Extracts textual information from images or videos to provide context for complaints.
  - **Metadata Analysis**: Gathers additional information, such as timestamps and locations, from submitted media.
- **Automated Response and Routing**:
  - **AI Chatbots**: Offers instant acknowledgment and preliminary responses to complainants, gathering further necessary information.
  - **Smart Routing**: Uses AI algorithms to direct complaints to the appropriate department based on the content of the submitted materials.

## Usage
To set up and run the Rail Madad Complaint Management System locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/agkavin/RailMadad-Complaint-Management.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd RailMadad-Complaint-Management
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit application:
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit/app.py
   ```

This will start the application, allowing you to interact with the complaint management system and explore its features.

## Conclusion
This project aims to transform the grievance handling experience for train passengers by harnessing the power of AI. By automating processes and improving response times, the Rail Madad Complaint Management System is poised to enhance passenger satisfaction and operational efficiency.
